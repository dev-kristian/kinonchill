### A Movie & TV Show Watchlist and Recommendation Platform

**Kino & Chill** is an interactive movie and TV show platform that lets users explore, manage curated watchlists, vote on Movie Night polls, and create shared experiences with friends! Built with modern web development tools, it leverages Firebase for authentication, Firestore for real-time data management, and TMDb API for media information.

## Installation & Setup

### Prerequisites:

- **Node.js** (v16.x.x or higher)
- **Firebase Project** with Firestore Database set up
- **TMDb API Key**: You will need to [register and create an API Key](https://www.themoviedb.org/signup) on TMDb to fetch movie and TV data.

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/kinonchill.git
   cd kinonchill
   ```

2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Set up environment variables:

   Create a new file `.env.local` at the root of the project or use the `.env.local.example` and just remove `.example`. Add the following environment variables, replacing the placeholders with your actual keys and settings:

   ```bash
   NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_API_KEY=your_firebase_api_key
   NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=your_firebase_project_id
   NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID=your_firebase_messaging_id
   NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_APP_ID=your_firebase_app_id

   NEXT_PRIVATE_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=your_firebase_project_id
   NEXT_PRIVATE_FIREBASE_CLIENT_EMAIL=your_client_email
   NEXT_PRIVATE_FIREBASE_PRIVATE_KEY=your_firebase_private_key
   NEXT_PRIVATE_TMDB_API_KEY=your_tmdb_api_key
   NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_VAPID_KEY=your_firebase_cloud_messaging_vapid_key
   CRON_SECRET=cron_secret_for_vercel_cron_jobs
   # Ensure characters like "\n" in private keys are correctly formatted
   ```

4. Start the development server:

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

   The app will be available at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

5. (Optional) Build for production:

   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```


## Firebase Setup

1. Set up Firebase by following the [Firebase Setup Documentation](https://firebase.google.com/docs/web/setup).
2. Add Firestore and Authentication (Google Sign-In and Email-Pass setup).
3. Make sure Firestore rules allow reads/writes for authenticated users.

### Firestore Structure Example

Here‚Äôs an example of the Firestore database structure for `watchlist` and `sessions` collections:

```
Firestore Database structure:

users (Collection)
‚îÇ
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ userId (Document)
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ username: string
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ email: string
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ watchlist (SubDocument)
          ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ movie: { <id>: true, <id2>: true, ... }
          ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ tv: { <id>: true, <id2>: true, ... }

sessions (Collection)
‚îÇ
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ sessionId (Document)
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ createdAt: timestamp
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ createdBy: string
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ userDates: { <username>: [{date: Timestamp, hours: [...]}], ... }
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ poll: { id: string, movieTitles: [...], votes: { <username>: [...] } }
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ status: 'active' | 'closed'
```

Ensure the proper security rules are set for Firestore, allowing users to only modify their own watchlist or session data.

## Testing & Linting

For linting, you can run:

```bash
npx eslint .
```

Tests can be added with Jest or other testing libraries for better coverage.
